# OPSEC / Safety

- Never paste API keys, private keys, seed phrases, or passwords into issues/PRs.
- Use environment variables and a password manager for secrets.
- Treat chat logs as public.
- For new dependencies/skills: read source + install scripts before running.

## Payment Safety
- Escrow is the source of truth.
- Payouts require explicit maintainer approval.
- Start with low-value bounties until agents are vetted.
